//  Temporary-file handling for opened Screen report PDFs (#804, #807). Reports carry
//  candidate identity, scores, and proctoring data, and Screen test IDs are only unique
//  within one organization, so each opened report is staged in its own single-use
//  subdirectory (restrictive permissions, unique path per invocation - reports from two
//  accounts with the same test ID can never overwrite each other) and deleted again:
//  shortly after the viewer has opened it, and at the next launch for anything left
//  behind by an earlier run.
