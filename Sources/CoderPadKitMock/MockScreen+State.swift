//  Per-client mutable state for the fake Screen API. Invitations sent, sessions
//  cancelled or deleted, and the webhook URL are layered over the immutable seed data
//  in `MockScreenFixtures`. Each `API-Key` gets its own `MockScreenState` (see
//  `MockScreenStateRegistry`) so the demo account and every test have an isolated store.
