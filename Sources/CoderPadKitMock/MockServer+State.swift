//  Per-client mutable state for the fake API. The session edits (pads/questions
//  created, updated, deleted) are layered over the immutable seed data in
//  `MockFixtures`. Each API key gets its own `MockState` (see `MockStateRegistry`),
//  so the app's demo account and every test have an isolated store — letting the
//  test suite run in parallel without racing on shared pad/question counts.
